    <description>-- PLEASE READ --

Make sure to restart the game post-launch after installing or after enabling / disabling the mod otherwise it will not work properly!

This mod will not work with pretty much all other mods that change backdrops!

This mod WILL WORK WITH AND WITHOUT CUSTOM STAGEAPI

Works with Mod Config Menu, allowing you to disable certain features

Best used with:
Nioffe's Better Doors (it has unique sprites for this mod!) or my custom doors
Darker Hell
Mega Satan's Bling
my custom devil and angel statues


-- New things --
- most main path levels have unique boss (and mini boss) room sprites
- some floors can have unique detail sprites (similar to the hanging chains in Gehenna or lanterns in the Mines)
- Catacombs is now actually distinguishable from the Caves
- Cathedral has new walls and better floor variation + big rooms have proper trims like small ones do
- the Gehenna backdrop now has 3 different types + unique post Mom's heart version
- new Burning Basement and Necropolis variant
- new designs for Angel rooms, Arcades, Devil rooms, Curse rooms
- new alternate path entrances

-- Changes --
- improved backdrop sprites for: Cellar, Mines, Depths, Dank Depths, Womb, Scarred Womb, Sheol, Libraries, Shops, Dice rooms, Isaac's / Barren rooms, Secret rooms
- improved lighting and overlay effects for Flooded Caves, Dank Depths, Mausoleum, Gehenna, Cathedral, Dark Room
- double door locks and lock blocks open faster
- more fitting props / colours for rocks / pits for some floors
- improved water effects for several floors
- blood filled rooms in the Scarred Womb now have bloody rocks and spikes
- the Dark Room now has proper bottoms for thin and L shaped rooms
- the blowing ash overlay in Ashpit is more transparent
- the Womb overlay is way less intense
- blood filled rooms in the Corpse have better floor visibility


Planned additions:
- more unique boss rooms
- improved Cellar
- fiend folio rocks / pits compatibility (stop asking!)
